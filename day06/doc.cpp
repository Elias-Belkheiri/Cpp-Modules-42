// Dynamic_cast can be used only with pointers and references
// // to cast from base to derived, the base class must be polymorphic
// // when a base is polymorphic, a run time check is done to ensure that the expression yields a valid complete object of the requested class, otherwise it returns a NULL

// Static Cast performs conversion between pointers to related classes, hence doesn't check for safety at runtime

// Reinterpret cast converts any pointer type to any other pointer type, even of unrelated classes.
